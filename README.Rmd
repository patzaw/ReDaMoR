[![CRAN_Status_Badge](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/ReDaMoR)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ReDaMoR)
[![](https://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/ReDaMoR)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ReDaMoR)

The [ReDaMoR](https://patzaw.github.io/ReDaMoR/) package allows the manipulation
of relational data models in R. It
provides functions to create, import and save relational data models. These
functions are accessible through a graphical user interface made with
[Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/).

A public instance of the Shiny app is available
[here](https://pgodard.shinyapps.io/ReDaMoR).

The main features of ReDaMoR are the following:

-   Create data model from scratch with a graphical user interface
-   Save data model in a json format
-   Import SQL data model generated with [MySQL
    Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/)
-   Document data types as R types (character, numeric, logical, ...)
-   Add comments to tables and fields to improve model documentation
-   Check and auto-correct model constraints (types, keys, uniqueness, mandatory
    fields)
-   Confront data to the model to check their compatibility
-   Support of matrices (\>= 0.5.0)

The [TKCat](https://patzaw.github.io/TKCat/) package relies on ReDaMoR to
facilitate the management of data from knowledge resources which are manipulated
as modeled database (MDB) objects.

The package can also be tested in [Rstudio
Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/project/1033803).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(ReDaMoR)
m <- model_relational_data()
```

You can also run the code documented in the [package
vignette](https://patzaw.github.io/ReDaMoR/articles/ReDaMoR.html).

# Introduction

In R, data are often stored in data frames which are tables in which each row
represents a record and each column a variable. Because data frames are highly
used they have been improved in different objects such as
[tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/),
[data.table](https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/) or
[AnnotatedDataFrame](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Biobase.html).

However, in many projects, the data do not fit in only one table but they are
organized in different data frames, each of them dealing with a specific
concept. These tables are often related to each other by some variables.
Depending on the diversity of the concepts, it can be difficult to remember what
these tables represent and how they are connected. Fortunately, because they are
tables, a set of data frames can be directly documented using a relational data
model.

The [datamodelr](https://github.com/bergant/datamodelr) R package provides tools
to document relational data. The generate data models are leveraged by the
[dm](https://github.com/cynkra/dm) R package to interact more easily with
relational data.

Here we present the ReDaMoR package which also allows the manipulation of
relational data models in R but with an approach quite different from the one
implemented in datamodelr. It provides functions to create, import and save
relational data models. These functions are accessible through a graphical user
interface made with [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/).

The main features of ReDaMoR are the following:

-   Create data model from scratch with a graphical user interface
-   Save data model in a json format
-   Import SQL data model generated with [MySQL
    Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/)
-   Document data types as R types (character, numeric, logical, ...)
-   Add comments to tables and fields to improve model documentation
-   Check and auto-correct model constraints (types, keys, uniqueness, mandatory
    fields)
-   Confront data to the model to check their compatibility
-   Support of matrices (\>= 0.5.0)

The [TKCat](https://patzaw.github.io/TKCat/) package relies on ReDaMoR to
facilitate the management of data from knowledge resources which are manipulated
as modeled database (MDB) objects.

# Installation

## From CRAN

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("ReDaMoR")
```

## Dependencies

The following R packages available on CRAN are required:

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
deps <- desc::desc_get_deps()
sdeps <- filter(deps, type %in% c("Depends", "Imports") & package!="R")
for(p in sdeps$package){
   cat(paste("-", cranRef(p)), sep="\n")
}
```

And those are suggested:

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
wdeps <- filter(deps, type=="Suggests" & package!="R")
for(p in wdeps$package){
   cat(paste("-", cranRef(p)), sep="\n")
}
```

## From github

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("patzaw/ReDaMoR")
```

# Documentation

in [this vignette](https://patzaw.github.io/ReDaMoR/articles/ReDaMoR.html).

# TKCat: Tailored Knowledge Catalog

The aim of [TKCat](https://patzaw.github.io/TKCat/) (Tailored Knowledge Catalog)
is to facilitate the management of data from knowledge resources that are
frequently used alone or together in research environments. In TKCat, knowledge
resources are manipulated as modeled database (MDB) objects. These objects
provide access to the data tables along with a general description of the
resource and a detail data model generated with ReDaMoR documenting the tables,
their fields and their relationships. These MDB are then gathered in catalogs
that can be easily explored an shared. TKCat provides tools to easily subset,
filter and combine MDBs and create new catalogs suited for specific needs.
